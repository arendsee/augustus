<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Incorporating RNA-Seq into AUGUSTUS</H1>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><BR><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This document describes a method for
structurally annotating a genome based on massive cDNA sequencing
(RNA-Seq). The guide below is a description of the method we
developed for and applied in the RNA-Seq based Genome Annotation
Assessment Project (<A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/PostGenomics/encode/RGASP.html">rGASP</A>).
It was applied to a variety of data types, such as from Illumina and
SOLiD, for read lengths between 33bp and 75bp, single and paired-end
reads, stranded and unstranded reads, on human, Drosophila and
C.elegans. We therefore expect this to be generally applicable to
other projects with some parameter adjustments. The general approach
is to generate hints for Augustus from the RNA-Seq, which can be used together
with hints from other sources if available (like from an existing
gene models, ESTs, protein or genomic conservation, MS/MS). The
approach outlined below is preliminary, and certainly can be improved
upon, e.g. by adding more information from the RNA-Seq in the form of
hints. Also, it is just one way to translate RNA-Seq information to
gene structure hints and you can adjust it for your processed data if you have
already a mapping or assembly of reads.
For example, if you choose to first
assemble RNA-Seq reads to contigs, you may just just treat them as
other larger transcript fragments such as ESTs and use
BLAT/GMAP+blat2hints.pl to generate the hints.

Align RNA-Seq Reads to Genome</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For species with many multi-exon genes
(most species), we found that <I>spliced reads are by far most
valuable</I>. Spliced reads are reads that span an exon-exon boundary
and therefore delineate a complete intron. It is therefore important
to chose an alignment method that recovers as many true spliced reads
as possible.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>1.1 Illumina:</B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In lack of a better program, we chose
to use the program BLAT, which is not customized for NGS reads (Next
Generation Sequencing), but found more introns than Tophat 1.0.11. However,
it is straightforward to adjust this pipeline to Bowtie/Tophat input,
because Tophat produces results in the same or similar format (wig
file and intron list including multiplicities).</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then filter alignments for alignment
quality, uniqueness and pairedness, if applicable.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">cat
ali.psl | filterPSL.pl --uniq --paired &gt; ali.f.psl</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This filter requires by default a
minimum coverage of 80% of the read length and a minimum percent
identity of 92%.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">--uniq</FONT>
makes the filter script keep only alignments, which are 1) the best
alignment for that read and 2) unique in the sense that all other
alignments of that read have a score that is at most 0.96
(uniquethresh) the score of the best. The rationale behind stringent
filtering is that self-similarity of the genome or of transcripts in
particular may otherwise yield many false positive alignments. False
positive alignments can be a greater problem to Augustus as false
negative alignments, the later may frequently be corrected by the ab
initio model aided by neighboring alignments.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">--paired</FONT>
is another filter that only applies to paired-end reads. It requires
that two reads from the same read-pair (when the read names end in
.f,.r or /1,/2) are on opposite strands, on the same genomic contig
and at most maxintronlen (default: 500000) apart from each other.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Repeatmasking alone usually does not filter out
  repetitions of DNA to the extend that RNA-Seq read mapping become
  unambiguous or false positive. From our experience it can happen that even with the stringent
  --unique filtering reads map to a likely wrong place in the genome. This is
  frequently a region that is not a gene but shows high genomic similarity to
  another region with a gene. You may therefore consider increasing the
  stringency of the filtering by removing hits from regions that are repeated
  similarly in the genome (and are not repeatmasked nonetheless). We chose to
  remove hints that overlap a self-chain alignment of the UCSC Genome Browser.</P><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The <I>exonpart</I> malus of .992 means
a weak penalty factor for every predicted exonic base that is not

malus factors. The concept of a local malus was recently introduced to
account for different levels of missing information, that becomes
more important with with higher general coverage of RNA-Seq. Like the (normal)
  malus, the local malus also applies to exonic bases that are unsupported by
hints. In contract to the normal malus, the <I>local</I>
malus only applies to exons, that are well-supported at some region and not
supported at another region of the same exon. The following picture
illustrates a typical case where the local malus applies.</P>

<IMG SRC="exonlocalmalus.png" NAME="graphics1" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=20 WIDTH=600 BORDER=0>
This UTR exon candidate is very unevenly supported by RNA-Seq coverage and therefore likely to be too
long. For every base that is not covered by any exonpart hint a local UTRpart malus
factor of 0.985 is applied in addition to the normal exonpart malus
of 0.992.</P>

The nonexonpart bonus of the RM source in this case is for
incorporating hints from repeat masking (src=RM). Augustus is run on
unmasked sequence with the repeat mask intervals given as nonexonpart
hints. In this regions, introns and intergenic regions are rewarded by
1.01 for each base.
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Above parameters have to be seen as an
example. The optimal values will depend on various parameters,
including</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">1) Amount of RNA-Seq and percentage of
genes expressed in the library. The more transcripts are expressed
and covered by RNA-Seq the stronger the malus can be. In the extreme
(hypothetical) case, all exonic bases are covered with RNA-Seq and
unsupported predicted exonic regions can be punished hard.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">2) The stringency of filtering. If, for
some other reason, you have chosen to include more than one
hit of a read or you allow best alignments also when they are
ambiguous, then you may get a significant false positive rate of
hints and you may have to reduce bonus factors significantly.</P>
